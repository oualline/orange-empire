# Orange Empire Signal Garden

This is the code that runs the signal garden and Acme traffic signal
at the Orange Empire Railroad Musuem in Perris CA.  

It is designed to run on a Raspberry PI and includes a couple of setup
scripts that will allow you to configure your PI for either a Acme traffic
signal controller or railroad signal garden controller.

Althrough this is probably a highly specilized piece of software, I've
found a surprising number of people can made use of it, so here it is.
